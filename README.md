# Cyber-Security-Playbook
### October 2020

As a recent convert from tech support roles to cyber security roles, I have spent alot of time researching the tasks I need to complete. Unlike Tech support where there is a wealth of available information, Cyber Security lacks in this way. 

One of the most troublesome tasks I have had is the creation of a Cyber Security Playbook, and as I am learning, there is a lot of considerations that need to be taken in to account. So as I am slowly piecing this together, I have decided to make a document and store it online.

In my research I stumbled across an Open Source cyber security playbook, which I found gave me no "plays". So I decided to try writing my own. I doubt anyone will read it other than me, but perhaps, if the research holds up, it could be a legitimate starter's guide to incident response for rookies such as myself.
